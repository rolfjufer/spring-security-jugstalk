It is the de facto standard for securing Spring-based applications, but can also be used in non-Spring Java applications. As with all Spring projects, the real strength of Spring Security is that it can be easily extended to meet individual requirements. This 2-day course provides a step-by-step introduction to using Spring Security in the context of Spring or Spring Boot applications. You will not only learn the basics of Spring Security, but also get a deep insight into the features of the new versions 6 to 6.1.', 'Zurich', 2, '2024-06-05', '2024-06-06', 1800.00, 1),
